## About the project

This application is a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

- GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
- WHEN I click the start button
- THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
- WHEN I answer a question (I get correct/wrong answer feedback in text and sound form)
- WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
- THEN time is subtracted from the clock
- THEN I am presented with another question
- WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
- THEN the game is over
- WHEN the game is over
- THEN I can save my initials and score

### User Story
